His narrative unfolds with the precision of a compass needle, pointing steadfastly towards his true north - a passion for innovation and a thirst for knowledge.
Like a sailor under sealed orders, Caleb's journey began amidst the hallowed halls of Benue State University, Makurdi, where he completed his Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences. Yet, within the confines of academia, Caleb felt a stirring, a magnetic pull towards the uncharted waters of the tech world. It was as though destiny whispered in his ear, urging him to set sail on a different course.
In a tale reminiscent of a modern-day explorer, Caleb's last two years at university saw him navigating the digital seas, seeking out online opportunities to chart his course into the realm of technology.
